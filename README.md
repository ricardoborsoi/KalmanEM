# Kalman filtering and expectation maximization for multitemporal spectral unmixing    #

This package contains the implementation of multi temporal unmixing algorithm proposed in the paper [1].

The code implements a multi temporal hyperspectral unmixing (MTHU) algorithm using physically motivated parametric endmember representations to account for temporal end member variability. By representing the multitemporal mixing process using a state-space formulation, it exploits Bayesian filtering to estimate the endmember variability coefficients, and an efficient implementation of the expectationâ€“maximization (EM) algorithm is used to estimate the abundances and other model parameters.


## Usage

The algorithm is implemented in Matlab, you can run it by running the following functions:  
-  `main_ex1.m` : example with synthetic data, it is the Data Sequence 1 in reference: https://arxiv.org/pdf/2303.10566. 
-  `main_ex2.m` : example with synthetic data, it is the Data Sequence 2 in reference: https://arxiv.org/pdf/2303.10566. 
-  `main_ex_Tahoe.m` : example with real data from the Lake Tahoe image, there real data example from reference https://arxiv.org/pdf/2303.10566.
